//All submissions for this problem are available.
//Cyael is a teacher at a very famous school in Byteland and she is known by her students for being very polite to them and also to 
//encourage them to get good marks on their tests.
//
//Then, if they get good marks she will reward them with candies :) However, she knows they are all very good at Mathematics, 
//so she decided to split the candies evenly to all the students she considers worth of receiving them, so they don't fight with each other.
//
//She has a bag which initially contains N candies and she intends to split the candies evenly to K students. 
//To do this she will proceed as follows: while she has more than K candies she will give exactly 1 candy to each
//student until she has less than K candies. On this situation, as she can't split candies equally among 
//all students she will keep the remaining candies to herself.

//Your job is to tell how many candies will each student and the teacher
//receive after the splitting is performed
