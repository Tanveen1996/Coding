//Farmer Feb has three fields with potatoes planted in them. 
//He harvested x potatoes from the first field, y potatoes from the second
//field and is yet to harvest potatoes from the third field. Feb is very 
//superstitious and believes that if the sum of potatoes he harvests from the
//three fields is a prime number (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number), 
//he'll make a huge profit. Please help him by calculating for him the minimum
//
//number of potatoes that if harvested from the third field will make the sum of 
//potatoes prime. At least one potato should be harvested from the third field.
