tower has height of . Because the taller towers tower over the shorter ones, Eragon can only
blow out the tallest towers.
Given the height for each individual tower, find and print the number of towers that Eragon can
successfully blow out.

my answer

static int castleTowers(int n, Integer[] ar) {
     	HashMap<Integer,Integer> has=new HashMap<Integer,Integer>();
        int largest=Integer.MIN_VALUE;
		for(int i=0;i<ar.length;i++)
        {
			if(ar[i]>largest)
			{
				largest=ar[i];
			}
        	if(has.containsKey(ar[i]))
        	{
        		int key=has.get(ar[i]);
        		has.put(ar[i], key+1);
        	}
        	else
        		has.put(ar[i], 1);
        }
        return has.get(largest);
        
    }
